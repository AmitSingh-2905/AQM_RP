\begin{abstract}
The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices for environmental monitoring has generated vast amounts of data, yet ensuring the security and integrity of this data remains a significant challenge. Low-cost sensors are prone to noise and anomalies, while open transmission channels are vulnerable to interception. This paper presents a robust, end-to-end secure IoT framework that integrates hardware-based encryption with a novel browser-resident Edge AI anomaly detection pipeline. We implemented \textbf{AES-128 encryption} directly on an ESP32 sensor node to secure data at the source. Transmission is handled via \textbf{MQTT over Secure WebSockets (WSS)}, ensuring compatibility with modern web standards and mobile networks. Furthermore, we propose a lightweight, client-side AI pipeline using a \textbf{Democratic Ensemble Approach} combining Moving Average, Auto-Regression, and Random Forest heuristics implemented in JavaScript. This approach shifts the computational burden from the server to the client (Edge AI), allowing for real-time anomaly detection and correction before visualization. The system is validated through a fully functional prototype featuring a responsive web dashboard that visualizes both raw encrypted streams and corrected decrypted data in real-time.

\section{Introduction}
Environmental monitoring using low-cost IoT sensors has democratized access to air quality data \cite{b1}. However, widespread adoption is impeded by two critical challenges: data trustworthiness and signal integrity. Traditional systems often transmit data in plaintext, exposing it to tampering or eavesdropping \cite{b8}. Moreover, low-cost sensors are notoriously noisy, producing spikes and outliers that can mislead users \cite{b4}.

Existing solutions often rely on heavy server-side processing for anomaly detection and complex VPNs for security. This paper proposes a more agile approach:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Source-Level Security:} We implement AES-128 encryption directly on the microcontroller (ESP32) immediately after data generation. This ensures that data is protected before it even leaves the sensor node, mitigating risks associated with compromised networks or insecure brokers.
    \item \textbf{Browser-Based Edge AI:} Instead of relying on centralized cloud servers, we utilize the computational power of the end-user's device (smartphone or laptop) to process data. This "Edge AI" approach cleans noisy sensor data in real-time using a multi-model \textbf{Democratic Ensemble} voting system within the web browser.
    \item \textbf{Universal Connectivity:} We employ MQTT over Secure WebSockets (WSS) to transport data. This protocol choice allows the system to bypass restrictive corporate firewalls and function natively within standard web browsers, enabling seamless access on mobile and desktop devices without custom apps.
\end{enumerate}

\section{System Architecture}
The proposed system architecture, illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:system_arch}, is designed to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability from the edge to the user interface. The system comprises three distinct layers: the Secure Sensor Node, the Intermediary MQTT Broker, and the Intelligent Web Dashboard.

\label{fig:system_arch}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Secure Sensor Node (ESP32)}
The sensing layer utilizes the ESP32 microcontroller, selected for its dual-core architecture and hardware-accelerated cryptographic capabilities.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Data Acquisition \& Simulation:} The node is programmed to generate synthetic environmental data, including Temperature, Humidity, and Light intensity, to simulate a realistic deployment scenario. To rigorously test the AI's anomaly detection capabilities, a pseudo-random number generator injects artificial faults—such as temperature spikes exceeding 40$^{\circ}$C or humidity drops to 0\%—with a configurable probability of 10\%.
    \item \textbf{Cryptographic Engine:} Security is enforced at the firmware level using the optimized `mbedtls` library. We utilize \textbf{AES-128 in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode} for its balance of speed and simplicity on embedded targets. The data payload is first serialized into a JSON string and then padded with null bytes to align with the 16-byte block size requirement of AES. A pre-shared 128-bit key (PSK) is used to encrypt this block, rendering the payload unintelligible to any unauthorized entity.
    \item \textbf{Secure Transmission:} Post-encryption, the binary ciphertext is Base64 encoded. This step is crucial for converting raw binary data into an ASCII string format suitable for transmission over text-based protocols like MQTT. The encoded message is then published to the public `broker.hivemq.com` broker on a specific topic, ready for retrieval by authorized clients.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{packet_structure.png}
\caption{Data Packet Transformation: The raw JSON data is padded to 16-byte blocks, encrypted using AES-128, and finally Base64 encoded for MQTT transmission.}
\label{fig:packet_structure}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Communication Layer}
To bridge the gap between resource-constrained IoT devices and modern web applications, we utilize \textbf{MQTT over Secure WebSockets (WSS)} on port 8884. Standard MQTT uses raw TCP sockets (port 1883), which are often blocked by web browsers for security reasons. WSS encapsulates these MQTT packets within WebSocket frames encrypted via TLS/SSL. This architecture allows the data to traverse standard web proxies and firewalls, enabling direct consumption by browser-based dashboards without the need for an intermediate backend server.

\subsection{Intelligent Web Dashboard (Edge AI)}
The application layer is a responsive, single-page web application that serves as both the decryption engine and the anomaly detection processor.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Client-Side Decryption:} Upon receiving a message via the Paho MQTT JavaScript client, the dashboard utilizes the `CryptoJS` library to decrypt the payload. The system uses the matching Pre-Shared Key (PSK) to reverse the AES-128 encryption. This "End-to-End" encryption model ensures that the data remains confidential throughout its journey, even while passing through the public MQTT broker.
    \item \textbf{Democratic Ensemble AI Pipeline:} The decrypted data stream is fed into a custom JavaScript `AnomalyDetector` class which employs a "Democratic" ensemble approach. The system aggregates decisions from three distinct "Expert" models to improve detection accuracy:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Expert 1: Moving Average (MA):} Utilizes Z-Score analysis on a sliding window to detect statistical outliers based on standard deviation.
        \item \textbf{Expert 2: Auto-Regression (AR):} Implements a Linear Regression model to predict the trend. Anomalies are flagged if the deviation from the predicted trend line exceeds a dynamic threshold.
        \item \textbf{Expert 3: Random Forest (RF):} A heuristic-based decision tree ensemble that evaluates physical bounds, velocity (rate of change), and deviation from the window median.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Voting \& Rectification:} A majority vote (2 out of 3 experts) determines if a point is anomalous. If flagged, the value is rectified using a weighted average of the AR and MA predictions (60\% AR, 40\% MA), prioritizing trend continuity over simple averaging. This ensures the time-series visualization remains continuous and readable, providing the user with a clean, corrected trend line alongside the raw noisy data.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Security Analysis}
The proposed system addresses key security requirements for IoT deployments:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Confidentiality:} By employing AES-128 encryption at the source (ESP32), data remains opaque to the MQTT broker and any intermediate network nodes. Even if the broker is compromised, the attacker only retrieves ciphertext.
    \item \textbf{Integrity:} The JSON payload structure acts as a basic integrity check. If decryption fails or produces malformed JSON due to tampering, the `JSON.parse()` method in the dashboard throws an error, preventing the display of corrupted data.
    \item \textbf{Availability:} Offloading anomaly detection to the client (Edge AI) prevents server-side resource exhaustion attacks. The system remains responsive even under high data loads as each client processes its own stream.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Prototype Implementation}
To validate the proposed architecture, a comprehensive prototype was developed. The implementation details are as follows:

\subsection{Hardware Setup}
The experimental setup is built around the ESP32-WROOM-32 development board, chosen for its integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities. A DHT11 digital temperature and humidity sensor is interfaced with the ESP32 via GPIO pin 4. The system is powered via USB for development, but is designed to operate on a 3.3V battery supply for field deployment.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{hardware_setup.jpg}
\caption{Hardware implementation showing the ESP32 microcontroller connected to the DHT11 sensor for environmental data acquisition.}
\label{fig:hardware}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Firmware Implementation}
The embedded firmware was engineered using the \textbf{PlatformIO} ecosystem within Visual Studio Code, leveraging the Arduino framework for rapid prototyping. Key components include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{WiFiClientSecure:} This library handles the underlying TLS/SSL handshake required to establish a secure connection with the MQTT broker, ensuring the transport layer itself is encrypted.
    \item \textbf{PubSubClient:} A lightweight MQTT client library used to manage the session, handle keep-alive pings, and publish the encrypted payloads to the topic `testtopic/1`.
    \item \textbf{mbedtls/aes.h:} We utilize the hardware-optimized AES functions provided by the ESP-IDF SDK. This allows for fast encryption operations with minimal impact on the microcontroller's power consumption.
\end{enumerate}
The firmware operates in a loop, reading sensor data every 2 seconds, encrypting it, and publishing it to the cloud.

\subsection{Dashboard Interface}
The user interface is built using standard web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript) to ensure cross-platform compatibility (Desktop, Mobile, Tablet).
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Visualization:} We utilized \textbf{Chart.js} to render dynamic, real-time line graphs. The charts feature a dual-plot system: a dotted line representing the "Raw" (potentially noisy) data and a solid line representing the "AI Corrected" data. This overlay provides immediate visual feedback on the AI's performance, allowing users to see exactly where and how the data was modified.
    \item \textbf{Cryptographic Verification Log:} A dedicated "Live Log" section displays the raw encrypted ciphertext alongside the decrypted plaintext. This serves as a visual proof-of-work for the encryption mechanism, demonstrating that the data on the wire is indeed unintelligible.
    \item \textbf{Status Monitoring:} Real-time indicators show the connection status (Connected/Disconnected) and the current state of the anomaly detection engine.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure*}[htbp]

\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{web_dashboard.png}
\caption{The Intelligent Web Dashboard. The chart visualizes the "Raw" sensor data (dotted line) containing synthetic anomalies and the "AI Corrected" stream (solid line) where spikes have been rectified. The log panel below demonstrates the real-time decryption process.}
\label{fig:dashboard}
\end{figure*}

\section{Results and Discussion}
Experimental evaluation demonstrated the efficacy and feasibility of the proposed architecture. The key performance metrics are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:performance}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{System Performance and Accuracy Metrics}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Observed Value} \\
\hline
AES-128 Encryption Latency (ESP32) & 12 ms \\
\hline
End-to-End Transmission Latency & 145 ms \\
\hline
Anomaly Detection Accuracy (Ensemble) & 98.2\% \\
\hline
False Positive Rate & 1.4\% \\
\hline
Max Stable Sampling Rate & 10 Hz \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:performance}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Security:} The "Encrypted Stream" log confirmed that data traversing the public MQTT broker was unintelligible without the key. Any attempt to intercept the packet resulted in a meaningless string of characters, validating the confidentiality of the AES-128 implementation.
    \item \textbf{Anomaly Correction:} The Democratic Ensemble algorithm successfully identified synthetic spikes. As shown in the dashboard charts, the "AI Corrected" line remained stable even when the "Raw Sensor" line exhibited extreme volatility. The system correctly filtered out 98.2\% of injected anomalies while maintaining the integrity of the valid data trend.
    \item \textbf{Latency:} By performing detection in the browser (Edge), the system achieved near-instantaneous feedback. The total end-to-end latency was measured at approximately 145 ms, which is well within the acceptable range for real-time environmental monitoring, confirming that the added security overhead is negligible.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Future Scope}
While the current system provides a robust baseline, several enhancements are planned for future iterations:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Advanced Cryptography:} Transitioning to AES-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) would provide authenticated encryption, ensuring both confidentiality and data integrity without needing separate HMACs.
    \item \textbf{Machine Learning Models:} Replacing the statistical Z-Score method with lightweight neural networks (e.g., TensorFlow.js) could enable the detection of complex, non-linear anomaly patterns.
    \item \textbf{Blockchain Integration:} Storing anomaly logs on a permissioned blockchain would create an immutable audit trail for environmental compliance.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}
This work demonstrates a secure and intelligent IoT framework suitable for citizen science. By combining AES-128 encryption with a browser-based AI pipeline, we ensure that data is both secure during transmission and reliable for analysis. The use of standard web technologies (WSS, JS) ensures the system is accessible on any device, including smartphones, without specialized software.
